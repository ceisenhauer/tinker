#' Identify Outbreaks
#' 
#' @description Returns a new version of df with two new columns: "outbreak" and "outbreak_id". The
#' the first is a bool indicating if an outbreak is present at that time point and the second is
#' an alphanumeric id with the format "{health-zone-name}_{number}" where the number indicates if it
#' is the first, second, etc outbreak identified (within the overall data) for that health zone. 
#' Arguments are available to play with the identification criteria being used. Please refer to 
#' the methods section of the final report for more information on how the identification algorithm
#' works.
#' 
#' @param df `dataframe` Historical data to be analyzed. note, this function has **strong** 
#'   expectations of column names.
#' @param min_weekly `int` Number of minimum cases expected per week during the 'main phase' of the
#'   outbreak. Note that gaps of up to `max_gap` in length are tolerated. 
#' @param min_size `int` Minimum number of cases required during the 'main phase' of the epidemic.
#' @param min_duration `int` Minimum duration (in weeks) required during the 'main phase' of the 
#'   epidemic.
#' @param max_gap `int` Maximum lull (in weeks) during which an epidemic can dip below the expected
#'   20 case per week threshold. Gaps longer than this period would indicate that there were two 
#'   seperate epidemics.
#' @param tail_threshold `int` Threshold of weekly cases needed for inclusion within the 'tails' of
#'   of the epidemic. 
#' @param tail_tolerance `int` Minimum number of weeks with an incidence below `tail_threshold` 
#'   required for the tails to end.
